# NOTES ABOUT THIS DATASET
- It was taken at 10:00 PM 11/13/2023
- When checking the OpenBCI gui beforehand, it showed that electrode 7 and 9 were railed (this was the best i could get, I was not able to locate them)

- This dataset was taken with the reconfigured cap (Gerhort's black 3d print, configuration documented in the report)
- This was the first dataset taken after I shaved my head
