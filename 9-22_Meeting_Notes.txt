FIRST TIME USER TRAINING
    User tries to move an image on the screen

        - 1st session: acquire data
            - 5 seconds each sub-session
                - rest, move up, down, left, right
        - loading screeen
            - model is training, magic is happening, ADVENTURE TIIIIIIIIMEMEMMEMEME.

        - On the back end: feed the data to the model and train
            - Which eletrodes contribute the best to a correct classification?
                - If all, then keep all. If less, then keep less

            - if accuracy of ML is < 70%, Do another round of sessions
                - Display to the user:
                    - Optimal electrodes have been selected, do another session
                    - 2nd session: see first
                        If still not good: do another
                        Max session number: 5 total sessions

GERHORT:

- 1st session: acquire data
            - 5 seconds each sub-session
                - rest, move up, down, left, right
    - Monitor resonant freq and DB levels of Freq.
        (amplitude of signal in freq domain)

    - Counts to see which freqs appear the most
        have the freq and a standard deviation

    - If the count of commmon freqs does not appear as often as we would like, ask them to redo session
    - Save the freqs to their profile
